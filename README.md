# CHINTA_SRI_DURGA_ROHIT-ML-LAB
This repository is for placing my Machine Learning Lab code implementations for 6th semester .

ML-Lab-01 (13-01-2026): Implemented Part 1 of the 1st lab practical of Machine Learning Lab. It contains exploratory data analysis on the USA Housing dataset, including statistical summaries, visualizations, and regression variable preparation as pre-processing. It also documents pairplot parameter testing where ma'am asked us to test it with giving any parameters and it returned an error also error has occured in the heatmap visualization due to one of the feature being the type of object and also Arpita ma'am gave us instructions and selection guidance for the the project to be done in the ml lab.

ML-Lab-02 (20-01-2026): Loaded tips dataset, performed systematic inspection, handled duplicates and data types, detected and removed outliers using IQR, encoded categorical variables, and conducted exploratory data analysis with statistical summaries, correlations, and effective visualizations like histograms, barplots, boxplots and heatmaps.

ML-Lab-1,2,3 (20-01-2026): Dataset provided by Dr.Arpita ma'am. I used the UCI Glass Identification dataset. I loaded and structured the raw data, assigned column names, removed non-informative features, and checked data quality using Pandas and NumPy. I also performed descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and exploratory data visualization, including histograms, boxplots, count plots, pairplots, and heatmaps, according to lab record 3 requirements.
