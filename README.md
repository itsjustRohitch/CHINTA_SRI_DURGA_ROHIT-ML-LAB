It also documents pairplot parameter testing where ma'am asked us to test it with giving any parameters and it returned an error also error has occured in the heatmap visualization due to one of the feature being the type of object and also Arpita ma'am gave us instructions and selection guidance for the the project to be done in the ml lab.
